# proj-C
 - I relly like this project due to the program has already comment so detail, and optimized. 
 	Its easy to understatnd and remember. 

## strtol and atoi

 - strtol provides you with more flexibility, as it can actually tell you if the whole string was converted to an integer or not
 - atoi, atol, atoll when unable to convert the string to a number (like in atoi("help")), returns 0, which is indistinguishable from atoi("0")

# The environment
 - USER contains your username.
 - HOME constains the path to your home directory.
 - PATH contains a colon-separted list of directories through which Linux searches for commands you invoke.
 - DISPLAY contains the name and display number of the X Window server on which windows from graphical X Window will appear.

#assert
 - Dont hold back, use assert liberally throughout your programs.
 - allows diagnostic information to be written to the standard error file. In other words, it can be used to add diagnostics in your C program.

## Error Codes from System Calls
 - A majority of system calls return zero if the operation succeeds, or a nonzero value if the operation fails.
